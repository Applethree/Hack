The game goes like this. First player will choose a container and take one or more chocolates from it. Then, second player will choose a non-empty container and take one or more chocolates from it. And then they alternate turns. This process will continue, until one of the players is not able to take any chocolates (because no chocolates are left). One who is not able to take any chocolates loses the game. Note that player can choose only non-empty container.


#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;
int a[10000000];

int main() {
    /* Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT */

    cin>>n;
    int val=0;
    for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
    {
       cin>>a[i];
       val^=a[i];
    }
    int res=0;
    for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
    {
       if((val^a[i])<a[i])
       res+=1;
    }
    cout<<res;
